							<p>
								<br>
								My academic background combines a strong foundation in computer science with practical, industry-focused training in game development. I graduated with First-Class Honours in BSc Computer Science from Manchester Metropolitan University, where I developed a solid understanding of software engineering principles, algorithms, and system design. 
								<br>
								To further specialise in game development, I completed an intensive Unity boot camp at Skills City, where I led and contributed to several game projects while honing my skills in gameplay programming, UI, and AI. During the boot camp, I also achieved the Unity Certified Associate Programmer qualification. 
								<br>
								Below, you’ll find a selection of the key projects I completed across both programs—each one demonstrating my technical expertise, creativity, and ability to work effectively in collaborative development environments.

							<p>
								As part of my game development boot camp at Skills City, I participated in a client-facing team project for the video game co-development studio, D3T. Our goal was to design and develop a 2D low-poly puzzle game from the ground up.
								<br>
								The image to the side outlines our project objectives and deliverables. As a team, we adopted the Scrum framework—an Agile methodology focused on short development sprints followed by review meetings. We used GitHub for version control and team collaboration, and Discord as our primary communication tool.
								<br>
								My contributions spanned across UI implementation, level design, and AI programming. I also explored tile and sprite art creation. For enemy behavior, I implemented A* pathfinding to allow enemies to chase the player by calculating the shortest route to their location. This system was based on the A* pathfinding tutorials by CodeMonkey on YouTube, which were incredibly helpful. (Watch them here).

							A few weeks into my game development boot camp at Skills City, we were assigned a capstone project to apply the Unity skills we had learned so far. Working in a small group of three, I took on the role of team leader and main programmer, drawing on my prior experience to guide the project.
							<br>
							Our goal was to create a fun, animal-themed game—and we delivered with Apple Dash, a fast-paced two-player game where players compete to collect as many falling apples as possible while avoiding dangerous falling rocks. Apples increase your score, but getting hit by a rock will deduct points, adding a risk-reward element to the gameplay. Players can move left and right and jump to dodge or catch falling objects.
							<br>
							The game showcased many of the core techniques we learned during the course, particularly the use of raycasting to detect ground and object collisions. It was a great opportunity to reinforce those concepts in a collaborative and creative environment.

							For my final year Project of my Computer Science Degree, I was tasked with creating an educational game. I decided to make a game that would teach people the basics of programming. I made the game in Java using Eclipe and was exported as a runable Jar File.

							<h2>University Click Game</h2>
						</header>

						<p>
						This was my first-year programming project during my BSc Computer Science degree. The brief was to create a click-based game using Processing, a Java-based creative coding environment. I developed Alien Attack!, a simple yet challenging reflex-based game where the player controls a spaceship under siege from alien flying saucers approaching from all directions. If any alien reaches your ship, you lose a life. Players must click on the aliens to destroy them before they make contact, with the difficulty increasing as more enemies spawn over time. 
						<b>
						I received a mark of 80/100 for this project, reflecting both the gameplay design and my implementation of core programming principles.

							As part of the App Development unit in the final year of my BSc Computer Science degree at Manchester Metropolitan University, I developed a feature-rich mobile coffee app using JavaScript, Cordova, and React Native. The project was designed to integrate with a RESTful API server and meet a comprehensive set of real-world requirements.
						
							<br>
							<br>
							Key Features I Implemented inclueded:
							<br>
							<ul>
								<li>Secure login system with verification token and asynchronous login checks.</li>

								<li>Coffee shop reviews, including the ability to take and upload photos directly from the app.</li>

								<li>Like/unlike and favourite/unfavourite functionality for interacting with user-generated reviews.</li>

								<li>Profanity filtering to ensure appropriate content.</li>

								<li>Interactive map displaying coffee shop locations with pins.</li>

								<li>Accessibility features to support inclusive use.</li>

								<li>Search functionality for browsing locations and reviews.</li>
							</ul>
							<br>
							The app was well-received by staff and peers, with praise for both its functionality and user experience. I achieved a mark of 84/100, reflecting strong implementation and attention to detail across technical and user-facing aspects.
