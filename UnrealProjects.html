								<h2>Unreal GameDev TV Course</h2>
							</header>

							<p>
								To broaden my game development skillset and gain experience with industry-standard tools, I completed the Unreal Engine 5 Developer Course by GameDevTV. Unreal Engine is widely used across the game industry, particularly for AAA titles, thanks to its powerful rendering capabilities, built-in physics, and visual scripting through Blueprints. Learning Unreal not only deepened my understanding of game development workflows beyond Unity but also allowed me to explore C++-based programming in a real-time 3D engine used by professionals.
								<br><br>
								Throughout the course, I completed a series of progressively more complex projects designed to teach core systems and game mechanics in UE5:
								
								<ul style="text-align: left;">
									<li>Physics-Based Fling Game – Spawn and launch balls to knock down targets, learning physics interactions and Blueprint scripting.</li>

									<li>Obstacle Course – Built a third-person platformer with jumping, movement, and hazard avoidance using a custom character controller.</li>

									<li>Toon Tanks – Developed a stylized tank shooter with basic AI for enemy turrets that track and fire at the player.</li>

									<li>Third-Person Shooter – Created a full combat system where the player can shoot enemies and take damage, integrating health systems, animations, and responsive AI.</li>
								</ul>
								Through these projects, I gained hands-on experience with:
								<br><br>

								<ul style="text-align: left;">
									<li>C++ integration coding in Unreal</li> 
									<li>Unreal’s physics and collision systems</li>
									<li>Character movement and camera control</li>
									<li>AI targeting and enemy behavior</li>
									<li>Level design and world building</li>
								</ul>
								<br>
								This course gave me a strong foundation in Unreal Engine 5 and has positioned me to take on more advanced UE5 projects in the future, complementing my existing Unity experience and expanding my versatility as a developer.

							<h2>C++ GameDev TV Course</h2>
						</header>

						<p>
							To strengthen my C++ skills and build a solid foundation for Unreal Engine development, I completed the C++ Fundamentals course by GameDevTV. While much of the content—such as loops, classes, pointers, and inheritance—was already familiar to me from my prior programming experience, the course provided a focused and structured refresher that helped solidify my understanding of C++’s unique syntax and intricacies.
							<br>
							Although the course content was relatively easy given my background, it was still valuable in getting me more comfortable with C++ syntax, conventions, and lower-level programming patterns. It also served as useful preparation for working more fluently with Unreal Engine 5, which relies heavily on C++ for performance-critical systems.
							<br>
							This course added to my versatility as a developer and reinforced best practices when working with one of the most widely-used languages in game development.
