                <p>For the Computer Systems Fundamentals unit, I was introduced to the fundamental principles and mathematics underpinning the design and construction of Computer Systems. We have covered digital logic and Boolean algebra, this was in the form of logic gates, circlets, truth tables Karnaugh maps and more. We have learnt the base components of a CPU and how they work such as the fetch execute cycle. We have learnt different base systems such as binary, hexadecimal and octal. We learnt how to use the Logisim program to apply what we have learnt in this unit, allowing us to build and analyse circuits.if you would like to download and use Logisim, you can do so from their website, you can click this link to go to it now: : &nbsp &nbsp <a href="http://www.cburch.com/logisim/download.html">Logisim</a> <br> We have also been learning various areas of mathematics alongside this, these include: Sets, Matrices and Vectors.

                <p>I feel like I have done well in this unit, but I need to improve, while I feel confident with the mathematical side of this unit, having done As Maths, completing all the work in seminars and having a good understand of the subject, I do not feel as confident with the other side. I am struggling with some of the digital logical concepts and am very lost on the operations of a CPU. I believe this is the subject I need to devote more of my time to and attend some drop-in sessions to help improve my understanding. I think I have applied myself well, turning up to every lecture and completing lab work, but as I said, I still need to devote more of my time.
