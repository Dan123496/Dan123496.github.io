            <p>In my Processing unit I have been learning to code with java in Processing. In this unit I have learn some of the basics of Java code. Later, in this unit we will explore and become more familiar with Java. For the first week in this unit I learn the basics of Java, what Processing was and how to draw simple shapes, colour, setting variables and more in Processing.  From there I learnt how to use "for" and "while loops" to repeat commands, as well as how to "nest" a loop in a loop. I learnt how to create a template line of code I could use again and again in our code, these are called procedures. I also learnt the basics of creating animation in Processing such as creating a bouncing ball or a car driving down a road.
            I have never coded in Java before so it took a little time to get used too but I have used similar languages such as Visual basic so I was familiar with some of the basic concepts, and this made it easier for me to pick up the basics of Java.

            <p> I feel I have being doing well in this unit and have a good understands of the basics of Java and how to use processing, I complete the workshops every week without too much difficulty and enjoy the challenge of completing them. I have recently completed a test on my use of processing. I answered every question and am confident I have achieved a very good mark. I believe I have applied myself well in this unit. I turned up to every lecture, every workshop as well as practicing using processing in the library IT suite in my independent study time.
