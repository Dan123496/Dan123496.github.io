            <p>For the Information Systems unit I have started to learn many of the business aspects of IT, I have studied system development life cycles and look at various forms of analysis such as SWOT analysis as well as covering Management Info & Decision Making. After that I learnt about database systems studying Use Cases/Use Case Diagrams and Entity relationship diagrams. For this unit I have also complete the first part of my assignment which was done together with my group as a group project. For the assignment we were given a scenario of a shop changing from a paper-based system to a digital system. We first identified the problems of a paper-based system. Identified the system requirements of installing a digital system. We then stated what data enquiries and management reports are and what data enquiries and reports we will use in our new digital system.

            <p>I feel like I have done well in this unit, completing the assignment to a good standard and worked well with my group members. Working with a group and giving presentations in our lab sessions has also helped improve my speaking and communication skills. I applied myself well, working in the library with my group in our independent study time to complete our assignments together, as well as using google docs so we could all edit our assignment together remotely. I feel I have a good understanding of what we have learnt so far, but I could do with revising this subject more in my spare time. 
            During my independent study, I found the book “an introduction to information systems” by David Whitely a very useful resource. If you would like to buy this book you can buy it on amazon from this link: &nbsp; <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Introduction-Information-Systems-David-Whiteley/dp/0230370500" title="Purchase An Introduction to Information Systems by David whitely here from amazon">An Introduction to Information Systems by David whitely </a>
