		<p>I am Daniel Standring, I am a 22-year-old from Manchester and I have just started my Computer Science course at Manchester Metropolitan. I have chosen this course not only because I have had an interest in all kinds of technology from an early age, but I also believe that my skill set, and good semantic memory lends itself perfectly for a course in IT. I have studied, IT at every level of my education, simple lessons in primary school, completed an OCR National Award and National First Award at GCSE, an AS Level in ICT and a BTEC level 3 Extended Diploma in Software Development. I feel my skill set has allowed me to enjoy, and achieve the most, in STEM fields. Many of the courses I have completed are in STEM and I feel these would also help with my future in IT. These include:  Physics and Maths in both GCSE and AS level as well as Graphics at GCSE. A full table of My educational history can be found below.
