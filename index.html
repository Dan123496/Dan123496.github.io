								<h2>About Me</h2>
							</header>
							<br>

							<p>I am Daniel Standring, a passionate programmer and software developer with over two years of experience in the gaming industry, specializing in Unity and C#. <br> <br>

								During my career, I have successfully ported two PC games, PlateUp! and Cuisineer, to major console platforms, including Nintendo Switch, Xbox, and PlayStation. These projects deepened my expertise in platform-specific SDKs, development kits, and compliance requirements, allowing me to deliver optimized, high-quality experiences across diverse hardware. <br> <br>
								
								I have also contributed to original IP development, working on gameplay mechanics, physics systems, and multiplayer functionality using frameworks like Photon Realtime, Photon Fusion, and Photon Quantum. One of my most rewarding challenges involved rebuilding a game in Photon Quantum, where I mastered deterministic physics systems and the Entity Component System (ECS) architecture. <br> <br>
								
								At Huey Games, I made significant contributions to HueyCore, the company's proprietary porting software that simplifies game development for consoles. My most notable contributions included creating runtime and editor optimization tools, developing a customizable dev menu to enhance usability, and integrating native saving systems for various platforms. These tools have streamlined the optimization process for future projects, improving efficiency across the company. <br> <br>
								
								In addition to my professional experience, I hold a First-Class Honours Degree in Computer Science from Manchester Metropolitan University an I am a Unity Certifed Associate Programmer. I have expanded my technical expertise through Unreal Engine C++ development courses and enjoy creating personal game projects, which you can explore here on my portfolio site.

								<br><br>
								I have had the privilege of working at Huey Games for over 2 years now, where I have gained invaluable experience and had the opportunity to contribute to a range of exciting projects. My time at Huey has been instrumental in shaping my career in the gaming industry. I've learned the intricacies of console APIs, gained hands-on experience with porting projects, and delved into the development cycle required to bring games to new platforms.
								<br><br>
								During these projects, I worked on improving and implementing new features into our company's porting software, HueyCore, significantly enhancing efficiency for future projects. I also contributed to an original IP, which allowed me to deepen my expertise in deterministic physics and Entity-Component Systems, strengthening my understanding of game architecture and performance.
								<br><br>
								Additionally, I gained extensive experience with networking code and SDKs for multiplayer games, and I developed optimization tools to streamline workflows. Collaborating with such a talented and supportive team has been an incredible experience, providing me with a strong foundation across many facets of game development. I am proud to be part of their journey in creating innovative software and impactful games.

							The videos above showcase personal projects I have worked on over the years in Unity. Click on the titles below each video to learn more about each project. 
							<br><br>
							I started these projects to deepen my understanding of Unity and game development while also indulging in my passion for creating games. Working on these projects has allowed me to experiment with various mechanics, improve my skills, and most importantly, have fun. 
							<br><br>
							Since beginning my journey in game development, I've always wanted to recreate some of the iconic games from my childhood. This inspired me to develop projects based on classics like <em>Super Mario 64</em>, <em>Pokemon</em>, and <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>. These games not only serve as a source of nostalgia but also provide me with the motivation to continue pushing forward, even when my free time is limited. Reimagining these beloved titles has been far more rewarding than working on generic projects, as they fuel my creativity and passion for game development.
							<br><br>

							My educational journey in software development and programming has provided me with a strong foundation and valuable experiences. I graduated with First-Class Honours in Computer Science from Manchester Metropolitan University, where I developed a deep understanding of programming principles and software development. For my final-year project, I created an educational video game in Java designed to teach people the basics of programming. This project allowed me to combine my passion for game development and education while demonstrating my ability to design and implement innovative software solutions.
							<br><br>
							Following my degree, I completed a Unity Boot Camp at Skills City, part of the IN4Group, where I worked on a group capstone project to develop a puzzle game in Unity. This project was overseen by Phil Owen, the Lead Engineer at d3t, and provided me with valuable insights into the challenges I would face and skill I would need in the industry. At the end of the course, I successfully passed the Unity Certified Associate Programmer exam, further validating my skills in Unity development and programming.
							<br><br>
							The skills and knowledge gained from my education formed the foundation for the start of my career in the game industry, leading to my first job at Huey Games. This opportunity allowed me to apply my academic learning and boot camp experiences in a real-world setting, further refining my skills and expanding my professional growth.
