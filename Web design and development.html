            <p>For my Web Design and Development unit, I have been making this very website. I have created this website by learning HTML and CSS code. Throughout this unit I have learnt the basics of HTML and CSS; HTML tags, how to make HTML lists, tables, adding images, links and more. In weeks one and two, I learnt the basics of HTML and CSS respectively. In week three, how to layout a website using the CSS box method; using containers, float, absolute and relative positioning. I also learnt about fluid, fixed and relative layout option. In week four, how to add different accessibility and usability features. I then learnt how to apply media quires to my CSS to edit how the CSS is applied on different screen sizes, like mobile or tablet screens. Finally, I learnt how to add transforms, transitions and animations. I have tried to apply all I have learnt over the past few weeks to develop this website. Beside is a screenshot of some of my HTML (left) and CSS(right) code which is used to create this website. I had previously learned some basic html as part of a BTEC I completed in college, however this was very basic HTML, only coded in notepad and had no CSS. This helped me somewhat in writing my HTML code, but sadly I had to relearn most of what I had learnt previously as I could not remember all of it.

            <p> I feel I am doing very well in this subject and have a firm understanding of how HTML and CSS work. I have applied the skills I have learn well in creating my website and it is a demonstration of my understanding of this unit. I believe I have applied myself well in this unit. I turned up to every lecture, every workshop, completed all the work in these workshops, completed multiple lyina.com tutorials on HTML and CSS as well as spending long hours in the library IT suite most days in the past two weeks.
            During my self-directed study and working on my website, I found w3schools.com/ to be a great source that help further my knowledge and understanding of HTML and CSS and this was very useful in completing my assignment. To visit W3shools you can click this link: &nbsp; &nbsp;
