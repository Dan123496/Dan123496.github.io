            <h4>Critical Thinking:</h4><br> <p>I apply critical thinking throughout my daily life;  I like to reflect on problems rather that going in head first. I like to know what’s going on around me and am always wanting to learn new things. I like to get my information, such as news from multiple sources to check it see if it is likely to be true, and to get a more rounded idea of how to interpret the information. I try to take the bias or leanings of a source into consideration when reading them. I also try to take my own personal bias and leanings into account when reading and believing a source, I don't want to reject information or ideas just because they go against or are bad for my beliefs or positions.
            I will always think about the source I get information from and whether it is reliable and trustworthy. At the same time taking in to account sources I like or trust, can have their own bias. I try to think about how people on the other side of arguments to me have come to their conclusion to see if I can refute it, if I can’t I may need to revaluate my positions. Although I don't like to be wrong, when the evidence is against my position, I do change my positions. <br>Sometimes I can be apprehensive and not do certain things or act a certain way if I think it may adversely affect others or lessen other opinions of me. Sometimes I think about problems too much and don't do enough doing. I don't know if such over thought can be considered "critical thinking”.</p>
			
            <h4>Professionalism:</h4><br> <p>I believe I display my professionalism in many In many aspects of my life. I always strive to be punctual, have perfect attendance, and complete work to the best of my ability. I am an honest individual and someone who can be relied to complete work and task. I always try to look professional take care not to be and appear scruffy. I also have proven to be someone people can trust in important roles and to lead. A examples would be; becoming a prefect and taking on extra roles at high school, helping to organise and run activities for the younger boys while I was at Boys Brigade such as training and leading the younger boys group in figure marching. </p>
			
            <h4>Communication</h4><br> <p>I feel I have good communication skills, I talk to and get on well with my peers, if I need help in a workshop I will ask for it, I don't just remain silent when I have a problem. I engage with classes and the lecturer, answer questions when I am confident of the answer. I feel relatively confident presenting in class but need improvement, I lose my place and don't know what to say at times, I also have bad "tip of the tongue" syndrome on occasions. I am a very good listener, respectful to others and always polite. </p>
            
            <h4>Teamwork and Leadership</h4><br> <p>I have worked well with my group in university to complete our assignment. I Always contribute and communicate with my group, I don't just stay quiet. Although I prefer to be told what I need to do, I don't mind taking the reins and leading a group. I work as part of a team in my part-time job in retail and get along well with my colleagues. An example of where I have had a leadership is while being a prefect at secondary school, leading my form. Also teaching and leading the younger boys with figure marching while I was a senior Boys Brigade Member.</p>
        
            <h4>Learning and Research Skills</h4><br> <p>I have good reading comprehension, and this allows me to be effective at reading through multiple sources and synthesise the information into my work.  What I need to improve in this area is my ability to decide which sources to use and where to find good sources. My decision making also need to improve as I find it hard to make decisions in many aspects of my life including my studies. I feel like I need to improve my time management and how to effectively divide my study time between the different area of my subject of study. I also have difficulty maintaining my concentration when working with distractions. These problems stem from my learning difficulty (dyslexia) which I am currently seeking support to help mitigate their impact.</p>
