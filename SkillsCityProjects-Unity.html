                <p>As part of my boot camp at Skills City, I completed a client facing team project for the video game co-development studio, D3T.
                     the goal was to complete a 2d low poly puzzle game. The picture to the side, shows our objectives and deliverables of the 
                     project. The team decided upon the Scrum lightweight framework, an Agile style methodology that uses short bursts of development 
                     time (a Scrum), with a review meeting at the end of each Scrum. We used GitHub for source control and collaboration on the project 
                     and communicated via discord.</p>

                <p>As part of the project I worked on the UI, Level design and AI, and also tried my hand at making tile and sprite art. The AI the enemy uses to chase the player is A* pathfinding, used to calculate the shortest route to the destination(the players location).
                    The code I used for this was based on the code in these videos from CodeMonkey on YouTube. - <a  href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waEsGu--9P8&list=PLzDRvYVwl53uhO8yhqxcyjDImRjO9W722">Watch them here</a> <br>

                <p>After the first few weeks, we were put into groups and asked to complete a capstone project. Our group was a 
                    three person team, with me as team leader and main programmer (because of my previous experience). The Game 
                    made use of many techniques taught during the course of the bootcamp, Most notably 
                    using Raycast to detect collisions.</p>
