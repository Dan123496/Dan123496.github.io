                <p>As part of my BootCamp at skills city, I completed  a clinet facing team project for the video game co-devlopment studio, d3t. the goal was to complete a 2d low poly puzzle game
                the top picture on the side shows our objectives and deliverables of the project. eam decided upon the Scrum lightweight framework, an Agile style methodology that uses short bursts
                 of development time (a Scrum), with a review meeting at the end of each Scrum. We used GitHub for source control and collaberation on the project and communicated via discord.

                <p>as part of the project I worked The UI, Level design and AI, and also tried my hand at making tile and sprite art. The Ai the enermy uses to chace the player is A* pathfinding, to calculate the shortest route to the destination(players location).
                    the code I used for this was base on the code in these videos from CodeMonkey on Youtube.  -  <a  href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waEsGu--9P8&list=PLzDRvYVwl53uhO8yhqxcyjDImRjO9W722">Watch them here</a> <br>

                <p>After the first few weeks, we were put in to groups and ask to complete a capstone project </p>
                <p>Here is a link to the final game on itch.io <a href="https://dannywtb.itch.io/farmyard-dash">FarmYard Dash</a></p>
                <p>The souce Code can also be viewed on my github</p>
                <p>Our group was a three person team, with me as team leader and main programmer (because of my previous expriance).  The Game made use of many techniques taught during the course of the bootcamp Most notable using raycasts to detect collisions </p>
